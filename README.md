# crowd-counting

For this project we have used multiple methods and pipelines, comparing and evaluating results to determine the best architecture for counting the number of people in a crowded scenery:

1. Cascaded CNN
2. MCNN + CSRNet, using VGG extractor
3. ViT-B/16
4. SAM + ViT-H
5. YOLOv8 (Fine tuned + integrated with Optical Flow)
